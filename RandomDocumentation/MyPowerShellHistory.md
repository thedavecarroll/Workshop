# My PowerShell History

Even though I've always considered myself a bona fide systems administrator, I've always been keen reducing replication

For most of my 25 years in IT, I've considered myself a systems administrator or engineer.
And, I've always been keen reducing task replication and increasing data integrity.

Like many others from similar backgrounds, I had access to computers at an early age.
I was 12 or 13 when I got my first computer, a Commodore 64, probably in late '82 or '83.
A couple years later, I got an Apple IIc with the tiny green screen and, later still around fall of '88, an NEC Multispeed EL laptop which boasted 640K of RAM and dual(!) 720K 3.5" floppy disks.

I wasn't hacking into Norad, though I wrote a short story that mimicked War Games.
In fact, I mostly played games and wrote short stories or managed role-playing game data on these.
TSR's Pool of Radiance probably definitely caused some issues in my first semester at Memphis State (now University of Memphis).

The first two semesters, I was following an Electrical Engineering track and had to use computers in several classes.
I learned a bit about Fortran and Pascal, about customizing the function keys on terminals, and several other "cool and nifty" things.

The first time I remember writing scripts was on a VAX VMS system at Memphis State in 1988.
I heavily modified my personal login script which was in DCL (Digital Command Language).
For a couple semesters, I was a computer lab assistant in a residence hall and helped students with word processing and other computery tasks.

My first real computer job was working at a small, mom and pop computer store.
We repaired and sold PCs and peripherals. We installed networks and setup servers.
During my time there, I got my A+ certification, downloaded drivers from vendor BBS’s, and a bunch of other things.

It was also the first time that I saw software development firsthand.
The owner, a retired telecom engineer, wrote an application for one of our customers in FoxPro.
